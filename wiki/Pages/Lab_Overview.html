    <h1>Wet Lab Overview</h1>
    <p>
        This summer Waterloo iGEM worked on making the CRISPR system more flexible and expand its applications. The wet lab focused in three aspects of this. A design of the modified sgRNA have been proposed in order to add restriction sites to exchange the target using classical cloning. In addition, Waterloo iGEM attempted to mutate dCas9 to recognize different PAM sites. Furthermore, we expanded the CRISPR-Cas9 systemâ€™s applications for eukaryotic systems, using <em>Arabodopsis thaliana</em> as the model organism. For more details on the design visit the links below.
